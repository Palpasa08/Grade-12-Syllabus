  <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> It promotes standardization across different database systems and applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Active vs. Passive:</strong> Data dictionaries can be active (automatically updated) or passive (manually maintained).</li>
  <li><strong>Components:</strong> Typical components include table descriptions, column descriptions, data type definitions, relationships, and access control information.</li>
</ul>


  <h2 id="dbms"> DBMS </h2>
  <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables users to create, manage, and access databases. It acts as an interface between users and the database, providing tools for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data. DBMS also manages data security, integrity, and concurrency. </p>

  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>1. Data Storage and Retrieval:</strong> A DBMS provides a structured way to store data, making it easier to organize, access, and manage. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data using predefined schemas and data models. DBMS facilitates quick and easy access to specific data through queries.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Slow Performance:</strong> For smaller datasets or simpler applications, DBMS can sometimes be slower than traditional file-based systems, particularly when handling complex queries or many concurrent users.</li>
      <li><strong>Overhead:</strong> DBMS introduces processing overhead due to its complexity and the need to manage various features like concurrency control and recovery, which can impact performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> DBMS can be vulnerable to security breaches if not properly configured and managed, potentially leading to data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access.</li>
      <li><strong>Centralized Point of Failure:</strong> Because all data is centralized, a DBMS failure can have a significant impact on all users and applications relying on it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


  <h2 id="models">Database Models</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>1. Hierarchical Model:</strong> Organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. Data is accessed by traversing down the tree from the root. Simple to understand and implement for certain types of data. Limited flexibility in representing complex relationships.</li>

  <li><strong>2. Network Model:</strong> Allows records to have multiple parents and children, creating a more flexible network structure. More complex than the hierarchical model but offers greater flexibility in representing relationships. Still limited in handling complex, many-to-many relationships.</li>

  <li><strong>3. Relational Model:</strong> Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows (records) and columns (attributes). Data is related through primary and foreign keys. Widely used due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ability to handle complex queries. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases.</li>

  <li><strong>4. Object-Oriented Model:</strong> Represents data as objects with attributes and methods. Supports complex data types and relationships. More closely aligned with object-oriented programming paradigms.</li>

  <li><strong>5. NoSQL Model:</strong> A broad category of database models that are not based on the relational model. Includes various types like document, key-value, and graph databases. Well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.</li>
</ul>


  <h2 id="constraints">Integrity Constraints</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Integrity Constraints:</strong> Integrity constraints are rules that enforce data quality and consistency in a database by limiting the types of data that can be entered. They help ensure data is accurate, reliable, and meaningful, preventing errors and maintaining data integrity. These constraints are essential for maintaining the reliability of a database and are defined using SQL statements.</p>

  <li><strong>Types of Integrity Constraints:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entity Integrity:</strong> Ensures that every row in a table has a unique primary key, which is not null.</li>
      <li><strong>Referential Integrity:</strong> Guarantees that foreign key values in one table match the primary key values in another table, maintaining relationships between tables.</li>
      <li><strong>Domain Integrity:</strong> Limits the possible values that can be entered into a column by defining a specific data type or range of values.</li>
      <li><strong>User-defined Integrity:</strong> Enforces custom rules and conditions specific to the application.</li>
      <li><strong>NOT NULL Constraint:</strong> Prevents a column from accepting null values.</li>
      <li><strong>UNIQUE Constraint:</strong> Ensures that all values in a column are unique, preventing duplicates.</li>
      <li><strong>CHECK Constraint:</strong> Allows you to define conditions that must be met when data is inserted or updated.</li>
      <li><strong>PRIMARY KEY:</strong> Uniquely identifies each row in a table.</li>
      <li><strong>FOREIGN KEY:</strong> Establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column in one table to the primary key of another.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="normalization"> Normalization</h2>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong> in DBMS is a technique used to organize data in a database efficiently by eliminating redundancy (duplicate data) and ensuring data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and establishing clear relationships between them. This process helps prevent data anomalies, makes updates easier, and improves the overall structure of the database. Normalization is typically carried out in stages known as normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.), each with specific rules to follow.</p>

  <section class="fbg" id="normal-forms">
    <h3>Normal Forms</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>First Normal Form (1NF):</strong> Ensures that all columns contain atomic (indivisible) values, and each record is unique. No repeating groups or arrays in any column.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Second Normal Form (2NF):</strong> Builds on 1NF by removing partial dependencies; all non-key attributes must be fully dependent on the entire primary key.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Third Normal Form (3NF):</strong> Builds on 2NF by removing transitive dependencies; non-key attributes must depend only on the primary key and not on other non-key attributes.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


  <section class="fbg" id="normalization-adv-disadv">

  <h3>Advantages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reduces Data Redundancy:</strong> Eliminates duplicate data to maintain consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Improves Data Integrity:</strong> Ensures accuracy by organizing data logically.</li>
    <li><strong>Saves Storage Space:</strong> Optimizes memory by storing data efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplifies Maintenance:</strong> Easier to modify, insert, and delete data without anomalies.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhances Query Performance:</strong> In structured databases, some queries become more efficient.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Complex Queries:</strong> Requires joining multiple tables to retrieve related data.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Performance:</strong> Excessive normalization can slow down data retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>Difficult for Beginners:</strong> Designing and understanding normalized structures takes practice.</li>
    <li><strong>More Joins:</strong> Increased number of joins can make queries slower and harder to write.</li>
  </ul>
